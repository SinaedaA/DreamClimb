# DreamClimb 🧗

A climbing route recommendation system for Fontainebleau bouldering areas.

## Features
- Web scraper for bleau.info
- PostgreSQL database with 300+ sectors
- FastAPI backend with filtering (based on boulder grades, styles/tags, sectors)
- React frontend (in progress) -- Learning JS now to replace this part entirely with my code and design

## Future Features
- Add user database (user info; gender, height, span), with ascent logging.
- Ascent logs + user info will enable boulder recommendations to other users, based on their own ascents.
- Enable community-powered boulder descriptor tags (_e.g._ people can add descriptor tags, such as 'heel-hooky', 'toe-hooky', 'reachy moves' etc, and users can vote on them if they agree)
- Add beta-links to boulders

## Contact
Feel free to reach out if you have ideas, or want to collaborate on this project. It's really a passion/learning project for now, but I do strive to create something useful for the community 🌟
